RAND-Someware Scenario 

4 Flags - 4 Weeks - Back2Back2Back2Back

Flag 1: Hidden as the password to login to the site
Flag 2: Custom node webshell will allow collection of files and deployment of the second stage
Flag 3: Install WMI persistance with flag embeded 
Flag 4: RAND-someware deployed - Decrypt the file to recover the flag. 


--------------------------

Required Development

- Node web app: 		'Photo Gallery' app allows for file download upload by unauthed users. Photo upload only allowed to admin users. Auth handled via http parameters e.g. ?login=<b64 encoded representation of user:pass>
- RAND-someware: 	Executable to handle a random file encryption, utilise UPX and VS-Obsfucation
- Bruteforcer: 		Python bruteforcer 

--------------------------

Progress:

RAND-someware: 	Mostly done -- just need to add obsfucation components
Node Web App:	Done!
